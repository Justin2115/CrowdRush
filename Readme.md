# Mumbai Public Transport Crowding Predictor

An AI-powered system that predicts crowd density in Mumbai public transport and recommends the least crowded travel plan.

## Features
- Crowd prediction (Low / Medium / High / Extreme)
- Best departure time suggestion
- Alternative route recommendation
- Safety-aware night travel guidance

## Tech Stack
- Python (ML)
- FastAPI (Backend)
- React (Frontend)
- Firebase (Database)

## Problem
Mumbai commuters currently cannot predict crowd levels before starting their journey, leading to unsafe and stressful travel.

## Solution
We use machine learning + real-world factors (time, rain, peak hours, events) to forecast crowd density and guide travel decisions.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run the application
